A Smart Agriculture and Wildlife Monitoring System with SMS Notifications Project for the Mercor Hackathon 

Design and implement a smart system using Raspberry Pi that integrates face and animal detection with soil water irrigation, allowing for efficient monitoring of agriculture and wildlife. The system should capture images using the Raspberry Pi camera module, process them to detect faces and animals, and utilize sensors to monitor soil moisture levels. When soil moisture falls below a certain threshold, the system should automatically trigger an irrigation mechanism to water the plants. Additionally, the system should be able to send SMS notifications to a designated phone number, providing real-time updates on detected faces, animal activities, and irrigation status.The Methodology for developing this Crop Destroying Animal Detection in Farm Environments and Alert Generation system involves several key steps. Firstly, the necessary hardware components are selected, including a Raspberry Pi board, PIR sensor, soil moisture sensor, external camera, water motor pump, and SMS and buzzer modules. Once the hardware components are acquired, the Raspberry Pi board is programmed to control the PIR sensor and soil moisture sensor. The programming also includes setting up the SMS and buzzer modules for alert generation. The external camera is connected to the Raspberry Pi board, and the necessary software is installed to capture real-time footage and process it for animal detection.

To ensure optimal performance, the PIR sensor and soil moisture sensor are calibrated to the specific requirements of the farm environment. This calibration process involves adjusting the sensitivity levels and threshold values to reduce the risk of false positives or negatives. Next, machine learning algorithms are trained using the footage from the external camera to detect and classify different types of animals that may pose a threat to the crops. The trained algorithms are then integrated with the PIR sensor to provide more accurate and timely alerts. If the soil moisture levels are low, the soil moisture sensor triggers the water motor pump to irrigate the crops. The water motor pump is connected to the Raspberry Pi board and is controlled by the programming logic. The farmer's phone number is also added to the SMS alert system to receive real-time notifications in the event of an animal threat or low soil moisture levels. Finally, the entire system is tested and deployed in the farm environment. During deployment, the system is integrated with the water motor pump to ensure proper irrigation control. The external camera is placed in a strategic location to capture a wide field of view, and the PIR sensor is calibrated to the appropriate sensitivity levels. Overall, this methodology aims to create a reliable and effective Crop Destroying Animal Detection in Farm Environments and Alert Generation system that can help farmers protect their crops from animal damage, optimize their irrigation practices, and reduce the need for manual labor.
